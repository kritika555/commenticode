          <p class="lead" style="font-size:1.2em !important;">The 
          <strong>Commenticode</strong> platform provides collaboration tools to developers, enabling them to work together on open
          source software. The collaboration tools are set up in a way that, by providing incentives, will facilitate the
          development of decentralised organisations.
          <br />
          <br />Through decentralised governance and by providing incentives in the form of tokens, the platform aims to put the
          control of important software in the hands of the community and encourage the creation of new and valuable software
          technology.</p>

          <b>How does it work?</b>
          <br />In the Commenticode platform, you can contribute to an existing software project and earn a share of the project
          with your effort. Or, you can create a new project, issue your own token and invite other developers to work on your
          project. To earn rewards, choose an already existing project, click on a backlog item you wish to work on, write code to
          complete the backlog item and submit it to be reviewed by other developers.
          <br />
          <br />Each week, all submissions for each backlog item are voted on and the submissions with the highest amount of votes
          will receive rewards in the form of tokens that represent a share of the project.
          <br />
          <br />Developers who review and vote on submissions are also rewarded for their effort.
          <br />A certain amount of tokens are rewarded once code has been submitted.
          <br />
